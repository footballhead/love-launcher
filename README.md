LÖVE Launcher
===============================================================================

Launches a [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/) process for the current project.

`main.lua` needs to be in the project root.

The command is `Love Launcher: Launch`; the keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Alt+L`.

You can change which LÖVE process is spawned by going to
Settings->Love Launcher and changing Lovepath; the default is
`C:\Program Files (x86)\LOVE\love.exe`

If something isn't working be sure to check the console.
